# Remove_Ngram_Duplicates

I once had this as an interview question: remove a duplicate n-gram in a range of 2 to 4 from a string.

So for example: "I love you I love you so much right now".

A hashing algorithm would definitely be faster that this NLTK n-gram-based solution, so I will provide that as a future solution (e.g. Rabin-Karp rolling hash function).
